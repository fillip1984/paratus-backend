# paratus-backend

Backend for habit tracking front end [paratus-native](https://github.com/fillip1984/paratus-native), which is a todoist clone I'm using to learn React Native

## TODO

- [ ] Build enough UI to make this backend worth while to visit, primary functions should be done through the front-end React Native app [paratus-native](https://github.com/fillip1984/paratus-native).
- [ ] Setup Oauth and enable the front-end React Native app to use it so that we can securely save off data from a mobile app __(THIS IS THE PRIMARY POINT OF THIS APPLICATION EXISTING)__
